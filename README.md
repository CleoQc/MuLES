# MuLES (MuSAE Lab EEG Server)

## Introduction

MuLES is a piece of software designed in LabVIEW, that aims at simplifying the use of common commercial electroencephalography (EEG) devices. It allows easy EEG data acquisition, recording and interfacing with other software (clients) programmed in any language that supports basic network socket programming.

In this sense, it is not necessary for the user to delve into the available SDKs and APIs of the different devices. Moreover, the provided common interface allows complete interchangeability between the devices, making easier to create applications that work with different EEG headsets.
